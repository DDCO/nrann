Number Recognition Artificial Neural Network

# How to run
You should be able to run this project locally on a browser if you wish. Or alternatively, you can view it at:

[NRANN](http://nrann-cdn.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)

You can either train the model yourself (beware, it will block your browsers UI thread) or load the pretrained model I host on AWS

Please note, I've only tested this on chrome. So if it doesn't work on another browser, I haven't bothered looking into it.
